\section{Introduction}

Your introduction goes here.  You might talk about previous work on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia \citep{brenner2014role}. Or you might want to explain how you used the Student \citet{student1908probable} \textit{t} distribution and present the formula you used to do significance testing for a correlation (see equation \ref{eq1}).
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
t=\frac{r_{xy} \sqrt{n-2}}{ \sqrt{1-r^{2}_{xy}}}
\end{equation}
