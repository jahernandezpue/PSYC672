\section{Discussion}

If effective, PNF for FAD could inform future intervention research targeting FAD among college students. If successful, this may be used as a stand-alone brief intervention (e.g., college campuses). This brief intervention can be easily administered (e.g., during college orientation or in freshman seminars, at the doctorâ€™s office) and may significantly improve student wellness.
